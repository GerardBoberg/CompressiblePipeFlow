# CompressiblePipeFlow

The purpose of this project is to model a compressible gas flow thru a
  pipe with a converging-diverging nozzle.

Friction and Isentropic Area change are modeled.
Heat exchange and Shockwaves are NOT modeled.

In addtion, pure isentropic area change and pure fanno flow methods are
  also provided.

# Useage

Run "MasterScript.m" to run the analysis with the default conditions.

You can also use the analysis methods individually by calling
